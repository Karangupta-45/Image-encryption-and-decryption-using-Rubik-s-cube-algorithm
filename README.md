# Image-encryption-and-decryption-using-Rubik-s-cube-algorithm
This is a novel image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. The original
image is scrambled using the principle of Rubik's cube. Then, XOR operator is applied to
rows and columns of the scrambled image using two secret keys.
We can even give the number of iteration to be performed to shuffle the rgb pixel vectors are scrambled and saved in the row vector and column vector.
