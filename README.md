# Image-encryption-and-decryption-using-Rubik-s-cube-algorithm
This is a novel image encryption algorithm based on Rubik's cube principle. The original
image is scrambled using the principle of Rubik's cube. Then, XOR operator is applied to
rows and columns of the scrambled image using two secret keys.
